# How-does-Super-Bowl-affect-TV-viewership-and-musician-rating

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes [riding giant mechanical tigers](https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=1) or [leaping from the roof of the stadium](https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62). And in this project, we will find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. We will answer questions like:

• What are the most extreme game outcomes?

• How does the game affect television viewership?

• How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?

• Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
